# DeepFlow App (WIP)

Minimalist focus app that uses an adaptation of [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

What I don't like about the existing pomodoro technique ?

- ** Disruption of Flow ** : Some people prefer to work for longer uninterrupted periods, others can only focus stay focused for 15min. Enforcing the 25min rule as a minimum followed by breaks of 5min can hinder concentration and creativity.

TBD
